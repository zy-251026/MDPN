## Abstract
MDPN is a lightweight neural network architecture that simulates the dendritic structure of pyramidal neurons to improve image representation, emphasizing nonlinear dendritic computation and neuroplasticity. In comparison with the traditional feedforward network model, MDPN focused on the importance of single neuron and redefined the function of each subcomponent. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed MDPN on 16 standardized image datasets.
